# MRI-SpIRe - the MRI Sparse Iterative Reconstructor

This package contains a simple iterative MRI reconstruction algorithm based on Compressed Sensing.
It reconstructs a series of MR images from undersampled k-space data acquired through a qMRI protocol.

For a theoretical background in Sparse Reconstruction and some examples of the functionality of the 
package, please check the included demo in demo/Demo.ipynb. For detailed instructions, read the documentation.

This work incorporates elements of existing algorithms for Compressed Sensing reconstruction in quantitative MRI.
